"PROJECT: Landing Page"

Author: chjwright91

Description: This repository was built using HTML and CSS only for the "Landing Page" project of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum. Within the repository are 3 files and 1 folder. In addition to the assignment, I added custom features for each link on the webpage. These links not only have the :hover pseudo-attribute, but are also anchor tags that will jump to the specified part of the webpage.
